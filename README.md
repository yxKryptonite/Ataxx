This is the course project(大作业) of ***The Introduction to Computation (A)*** in Peking University.

I inplemented the basic function and a couple of advanced funcs, including different modes, animes and so on.

My algorithm used here is the vallina *MinMax*, which can be improved in the future.

Hope you enjoy it!
